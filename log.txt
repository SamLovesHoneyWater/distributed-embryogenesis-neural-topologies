Log
2021/06/09	Implemented network visualization with networkX
    			Need to further optimize visual experience of networkX
    		Encountered RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison
    			Also, recursion is slow
    			Inefficiency in both space and time
    			Need to find a new approach to feed-forward
    			Perhaps take a look at how NEAT algorithms are implemented
    		Mutation and reproduction algorithms seem to take a lot of time
    			No actual timer measurement yet
    			Need to measure
    			If indeed time-consuming, need to think of ways to optimize
    		Mutation and reproduction algorithms are stupid and bias the search space
    			Need to rework how genes are mutated and agents are reproduced

2021/06/21  Responding to previous development logs:
                NEAT algorithms are implemented without back prop, hence no Tensorflow
                RecursionError should be caused by loops in should-be acyclic graphs
            Added DAG ensurement
                Time consumption (in complex topologies) not investigated

2021/08/31  Switching to an easier task:
                Small dimensionality visual classification
                Replicated "retina" example in Clune's modularity paper
                'The evolutionary origins of modularity' by Jeff Clune et al
            Fixed fitness-descent
                Such a stupid bug
            Ideas to more effective evolution:
                Introduce connection cost and Pareto frontiers

2021/09/02  Adding more diverse mutation methods
                Allowing a connection gene to mutate so as to be followed by a new
                    insertion gene that inserts a node on the connectinon created
                Randomly creating a new connection gene at the end of the genome
            Ideas to more effective evolution:
                Introduce Pareto frontiers (as per Aug 31st)
                Use same initial markings for all i/o nodes (-1/-2)
                Introduce initial asymmetry (need more thought)
